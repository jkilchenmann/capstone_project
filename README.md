# Predicting Airline Flight Times

This project involves the creation of a machine learning model to determine whether it is possible to accurately predict flight times.  The model will specifically predict flight times for one or more specific days between two airports in the continental United States using a dataset of 1,127 flights the author personally completed during the period from 2004 - 2025.  The dataset is contained in Log.csv.

Additional details will be added to the readme as the project progresses.
